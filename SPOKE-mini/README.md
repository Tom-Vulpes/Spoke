Spoke MINI firmware instructions:

Step 1. Download the most recent Circuitpython uf2 file from here: https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico/ 

Step 2. Hold down the Bootsel button on the Pico <b>while</b> plugging in the USB cable.

Step 3. Drag and drop the Circuitpython uf2 file onto the Rpi device.

Step 4. Wait for the firmware to flash onto the device, it will dissappear for a second and come back as a CIRCUITPY device.

Step 5. Download the Libraries Bundle .zip file here: https://circuitpython.org/libraries

Step 6. Find the libraries for Adafruit_MIDI and drag it from the zip file into the CIRCUITPY device into the folder called 'lib'

Step 7. Open the code.py file either in an IDE like Thonny, or in Notepad if you're just starting out.

Step 8. Copy and Paste the example code here: https://github.com/Tom-Vulpes/Spoke/blob/main/SPOKE-mini/MIDI%20examples/MIDI-USB%20-%20single%20notes%20-%20polyphony and save it as code.py. Make sure you odn't save it as any other file name, as the device runs whatever is in code.py on startup.
